Modifying Windows update settings can be risky and can lead to security vulnerabilities.
It is recommended that you keep your Windows updates enabled and install the latest
security patches to keep your system secure.

However, if you still want to disable Windows update and block the check for updates,
you can use the following PowerShell command:

```
Set-Service -Name wuauserv -StartupType Disabled
```

This command will disable the Windows Update service and prevent it from starting automatically.
To block the check for updates, you can create a new registry key using the following PowerShell
command:

```
New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" -Name "AU" -Force
```

This will create a new registry key named "AU" under the WindowsUpdate folder in the registry.
To block the check for updates, you need to set the value of the "AU" key to 1. You can do this
using the following PowerShell command:

```
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU" -Name "NoAutoUpdate" -Value 1 -Force
```

This command will create a new registry value named "NoAutoUpdate" and set its value to 1.
This will block the check for updates. Note that you may need to restart your computer for
these changes to take effect.

Again, it is not recommended to disable Windows update and block the check for updates as
this can make your system vulnerable to security risks. It is better to keep your system
up-to-date with the latest security patches.
